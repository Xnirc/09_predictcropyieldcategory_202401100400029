This project focuses on predicting crop yield levels (low, medium, high) using machine learning. It uses features like soil quality, rainfall, and seed type to train a classification model. The goal is to support smarter agricultural decisions through data-driven yield prediction.
This project aims to predict crop yield categories—low, medium, or high—based on key agricultural factors such as soil quality, rainfall, and seed type. Using a machine learning approach, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, the model is trained on a labeled dataset to classify yield levels accurately. The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps like label encoding and train-test splitting. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure performance. Visualizations including feature importance and confusion matrix provide insights into the model's behavior. This predictive tool can assist farmers and agricultural planners in making informed, data-driven decisions for improving crop productivity.
